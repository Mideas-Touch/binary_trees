 # Binary Search Trees
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree where each node of this tree stores a key and the key value of a node is more than or equal to all of the key values in its left subtree and less than or equal to all key values of nodes in its right subtree.

A BST may be used to store data in non-contiguous locations is computer memory.
Each node of the BST will have two pointers; to the left node and the right node. Additionally, each node of the BST typically will have a key, a value and two pointers for the left and right nodes. The leaves of the BST will have null left and right pointers a they do not show any other node.

Operations that can be performed of a BST include searching a key value, and finding the maximum and minimum values stored in a BST.
